Implementing Function Overloading

This is an example of a simple implementation of function overload support in Python.
It demonstrates how, using the tools already available in Python, one of the limitations of the base implementation can be circumvented. A minimum of features is supported (only a fixed number of positional arguments, no named arguments, no type casting (for example, int -> float), etc.), but it works quite quickly.
